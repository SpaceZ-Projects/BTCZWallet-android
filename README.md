BTCZWallet-android
==========

**BTCZWallet-android** is a lightweight **mobile client** for
[BTCZWallet-win](<https://github.com/SpaceZ-Projects/BTCZWallet-win>).  
It connects to the server via **HTTPS over Orbot (Tor proxy)** to provide a secure
and private way of managing **BitcoinZ (BTCZ)** on Android devices.

Privacy & Security
------------------

- All communication is routed through **Tor** (via Orbot).  
- The Android client never talks to the server directly.  
- Only your server (BTCZWallet-win) holds and secures wallet data.

9. Confirm the **Allow USB debugging** prompt on your device.  

Running on a Device
-------------------

Once your device is ready and connected, you can install and run the app with::

- Briefcase will detect available devices through **adb**.  
- If more than one device/emulator is connected, you will be prompted to select the target device by name.  
- After selection, Briefcase will install the APK and launch the app automatically.  

You can also verify that your device is connected with::

    adb devices

This should list your device ID before running the app.
